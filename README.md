# YouTube Clone
After learning HTML and CSS, I wanted to put my skills into practice and create a youtube clone.

This is the live deployment: https://jmen121.github.io/youtube-clone1/ 

# Lessons Learned
Throughout the development of this YouTube clone, I acquired proficiency in employing different techniques for creating boxes to ensure optimal alignment of video previews and titles. I leveraged tools such as Flexbox and the Grid method to achieve precise layout structures.I also learned Tooltips( which can be seen for every icon on header except the Profile),

Initially, I encountered challenges in managing the sheer volume of elements to create and understanding the nuances of box alignment, be it vertical or horizontal. During this learning process, W3Schools played a pivotal role in providing invaluable assistance, contributing significantly to overcoming the initial hurdles.

# Optimizations

The code underwent several optimizations, with a focus on enhancing accessibility, performance, and code quality. Notable modifications include:

Accessibility Improvements:

Inclusion of alternative text for images, ensuring a more inclusive experience for users with varying abilities.
Semantic Code Enhancement:

Ensuring the correct usage of semantic HTML elements to adhere to best practices and bolster accessibility.
Dynamic Sizing:

Implementation of dynamic sizing features within the YouTube Clone for a responsive and adaptable user interface.


# What's Next?
To elevate the YouTube clone's functionality, the next phase involves incorporating JavaScript to introduce reactivity. This will involve making the links more interactive and responsive to user actions.
